# Nand-2-Tetris
Implementation of a complete computer from Nand gates on up as described in the book:  
"The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken.  

## Summary of Projects
- Project 1: Boolean Logic - Developing complex 16-bit HDL chips like DMUX16.  
- Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic - Creating HDL bit shift, adders, and ALU.  
- Project 3: Sequential Logic - Developing HDL timed chips including 16K RAM.  
- Project 4: Machine Language - Assembly language programming with arithmetic operations and basic display functions.  
- Project 5: Computer Architecture - Constructing CPU, RAM space, and a complete computer.  
- Project 6: Assembler - Assembler for Hack assembly language to binary code conversion.  
- Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic - Basic VM-to-assembly translator for stack arithmetic and memory commands.  
- Project 8: VM II: Program Control - Advanced VM-to-assembly translator for branching and functions.  
- Project 9: High-Level Language - Jack examples.  
- Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis - Jack syntax analyzer producing XML structure representation.  
- Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation - Comprehensive Jack-to-VM compiler.  
- Project 12: Operating System - Full Jack OS API implementation, including various classes.
